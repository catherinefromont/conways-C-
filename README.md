This is my Conways Game of Life Implementation in C++.

To run the code in terminal you must:

1. Compile the code using *g++* (if that doesn't work look it up on Google)
2. then run *g++ conways.cpp -o conways* (assuming there are no errors it will not do anything which is good!)
3. then run *./conways* - and watch it go!
